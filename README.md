# Madlibs-Generator
# Overview
This Python project facilitates dynamic text substitution based on user input. The script reads a pre-written story from a file, identifies placeholders marked by < and >, and prompts the user to replace these placeholders with their own words. The final story reflects these substitutions, allowing for a customized and unique reading experience each time.
